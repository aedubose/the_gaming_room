# the_gaming_room

The gaming room was a client that wanted to be able to run on multiple platforms instead of mostly one with the least amount 
of restrictions and complications.

Being able to complete this project was a challenge with the directives and code to make this happen for the client. Overall the program 
was succesful and fun to work with. Being able to accomplish the cross platform framwork was vital to the success of this project.
